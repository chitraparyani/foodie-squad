## Web Design- Final Project

## Description

1. The restaurant data comes from EatStreet API.
2. User can view the restaurant and the ratings given by user.
3. For giving rating User needs to login first.
4. Upon Login User can upload profile pic, update his ratings and delete them.
5. User can also add ratings on the restaurant details page.
6. On the home page top users and top restaurants based on ratings are shown.


## Project Goals:

1. Your application should have some form of create, read, update and delete operations.
2. You can either implement backend using Nodejs/mongo or just use any open APIs.
3. No shopping site.

## Technical Requirements:




## Backend Node server and MongoDB connection

Run `nodemon server.js` to start the mode server.

Open `http://localhost:3000/api` followed by routes addres to open various apis.

## Frontend Development server

Run `npm install` to first install all the dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
